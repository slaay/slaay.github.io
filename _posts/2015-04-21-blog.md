Some of the best blog I have come across from the people belonging to the technical world be

* ###[Coding Horror](http://blog.codinghorror.com/)
  * This is a blog by Jeff Atwood, i have been reading the blog for some time now and i really love this one!

* ###[Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/)
  * This one is by  Joel Spolsky and its one of my favourite blog. This blog has given me lots of knowledge to help me grow as a Software Profressional.

  If you dont know both of these blogger co founded the [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), the site that every programmer loves. Just not because you get the answers to your problems but also because you learn a whole lot of things from the site.
  Millions of programmers visit this site everyday and share and learn from the best coder out there. I know how much this site has helped me ;)
