Need to know
------------
Im not an expert but I would like to share a tip or two on team management. For someone who has just be put in charge of a team, big or small, its a big thing as you are no longer the follower but you are the leader.

Well there is a saying “To lead, one must first learn to follow “. In any office environment its going to be exciting for you but then you start feeling the pressure of leading a team. Its best to soak up the pressure and learn how to use it to drive you. When your are leading a team, “drive” is what you need. Bossing around others never helps even if your the boss yourself. It will only send invite to your team to not like you or lookup to you. People as human nature is having a never ending desire to find a common enemy and believe me that is the last thing you want.

Understanding yourself
------------
Leading a team is about understanding yourself, your strength , your weakness and how you view others. Your team mates are not you subordinates but they are are partners.

There is another thing, I am sure of the source of the quote but it goes something like this “Tell good things about one person in open and bad things to him in person”. People like to be appreciated, go ahead appreciate your team it will help you gain their support and trust.

There will be times when you have to be a dictator, Times when you're a democratic leader and times when you have to be aggressive towards the team else people as they are, will start taking you for granted.

“The weak can never forgive."
------------
Mahatma said “The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong“. Be strong no matter how things go wrong, learn to forgive. No matter how much someone messed up, forgive,  as the only way to go ahead is together. Even you will mess up and you will need the support of your team.

For any team to b successful the most important thing is communication, you may be Einstein of coding but if you do not communicate you are a dead weight in a team.
As a leader its you duty to make sure people communicate, involve people, make then gel.
Remember a well gelled team is like a well oiled machine..smooth is the word that comes to my mind thinking of such a team.

There will b ups and there will be downs, there will be the days when you want to run home screaming “I cant take it anymore”. One thing that matters is how you evolve and use your experience to your benefit.

The Last Man Standing
------------
Lastly as a leader, For your team, you have to a constant, a fixed point, The Last Man Standing.
