To finish the flying home made drone powered by Raspberry Pi i will need to
hook it to a camera too (Drone should be able to show me live footage while flying!).

While hunting online for a Raspberry Pi camera module i came across this article

[Codeproject - Raspberry pi camera](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/665518/Raspberry-Pi-as-low-cost-HD-surveillance-camera)
The article describes how you can use Raspberry Pi with a camera and create a low cost HD surveillance system.

The total cost to build a low cost HD surveillance system can be as little as 5K or even less. Now all this you will have to build yourself but its 
going to be alot of fun.

Drone with camera
------------
There are lots of stores selling the camera module for Pi. So after i buy the Raspberry Pi itself and getting it working. 
I am little confused as  to what to buy next?

 * Drone itself
 * Camera

buying the drone is not useful with the camera and buying the camera is not useful with the drone!
But i see more things to do with the camera with Pi then drone and Pi. I am still thinking though.
