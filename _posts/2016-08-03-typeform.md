Goodbye forms. Hello typeforms.
------------
If you haven't tried the typeforms then you must be crazy!. I came across the typeforms just a couple of days back when my friend pinged
me and told me about this cool thingy called *[typeforms](https://www.typeform.com/)*. First I thought it must be some sort of help form that cools pretty cool. 
Then I saw the examples and I was blown away!

Interface
------------
The interface is really simple and well thought out, you will love it!

Use cases?
------------
Oh man, there are so many places where you can use this!. I used to think that I will have to design such cool things in CSS but thankfully 
they already have the interface ready.
The use cases are limitless, how about?
    - Invitation form?
    - Data collection?
    - customised employee survey form?
check out the example by [typeforms examples](https://www.typeform.com/examples/#Information)
