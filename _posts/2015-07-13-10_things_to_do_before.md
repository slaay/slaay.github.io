10 things to do before i turn 28!
------------
(**By the way I'm only 26 at the time of writing this blog**) <br/>

  * <b>#1. Learn to play guitar</b><br/>
      I took up guitar back in 2008 for 2 months, however from 2008 till this day I have not played it!. So this tops my list of things to do before I turn 28.
      One of my best friend (Shirish revankar) had once told me that "I want to learn at least one  musical instrument before I die".

  * <b>#2. Buy an iPhone</b><br/>
      This one strictly for coding purpose (I hate Apple, though this blog was written on a Mac Mini ;))

  * <b>#3. 6 pack abs!</b><br/>
      Again this one is something that I want any how, I have been working out now since February 2015 (running, crunches, skipping, healthy food etc). I want to sport a 6 pack abs body, not like other programmers you see on the Internet with a Pot belly! I am not much into bulking up however I am more into the fitness thingy.

  * <b>#4. Release my first mobile app</b><br/>
      I have lots of ideas to work on though there are hurdles like #2 Buy an iPhone to test the app. In terms of ideas to work on I have many (no shortage in that dept.) I may start with Android development with Java (I have JAVA!) or .Net or Web technologies or hybrid ones like Delphi.

  * <b>#5. Learn Swift</b><br/>
      Yay another Apple thingy, anyways it excites me alot. I took a little time to get my head around Objective C so my next challenge is to conquer Swift and build beautiful mobile apps.

  * <b>#6. My very own ASP.net website</b><br/>
      I love Microsoft technologies and having something of my own in .Net is a dream for me right from my engineering student days. I would love to build a mobile website using C#.net and MS SQL server with [MVC](http://slaay.github.io/2015/07/02/MVC_for_Me/) off course. 

  * <b>#7. Get a few more stars on my GitHub repos</b><br/>
     At the time of writing this my GitHub repo [Slaay](https://github.com/slaay) had one start and 2 forks, I am to at least double that with some cools commits!

  * <b>#8. Raspberry pie!</b><br/>
     Get up and running with a IOT app and a device built using [Raspberry pie](http://slaay.github.io/2015/04/06/Internet_of_Pi/). This one really gives me sleepless nights, I really want to built something for IOT.
     I have worked on my ideas on this too, so only issue here is getting Raspberry pie and hitting the ground running.

  * <b>#9. Go outside goa for a holiday!</b><br/>
     I want to take my parents out for a holiday outside Goa, mostly some where at a hill station. I do not want to go by bus or train I want to fly there!.

  * <b>#10. Finally, have lots more fun!</b><br/>
     Oh yes! all work and no play makes a man dull. So I want I enjoy and have loads of fun aiming of the Top 9 things in my list of things to do before I turn 28!
