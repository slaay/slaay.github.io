Sedentary life style
------------
I just came across a saying today which went something like this "If you don't spend some time on your fitness now then you will be spending all your time later in sickness". For professionals who sit in-front of the a computer screen this saying holds true!.
As we (software guys) spend hours upon hours staring at the system, banging our brains out day in and day out, our health takes a dip! We will end up having problems later in life. Now don't think the "Later" will be 40-50 years later! oh no! it can be just 30 days away when you encounter your first health problem due to your sedentary life style.

Fitness
------------
I have been working now for past 4.5 years staring away my life at the IDE and slowly my tummy was getting bigger and bigger, so I decided it now or never that I need to slim down and make sure I stay fit so that I do not have problems later!
Initially it was just walking. Which was not helping me a lot in the fitness and weight department, so I decided to go on a diet
though it was not an extreme diet, still it was of no help ;( . Then finally I decided it time to hit the gym (but no cash ;(). But
then i got an idea to go running! It was the best decision ever for my health! 

Being a software guy takes a mental toll on the brain too. Doing hard and mentally intensive task week in and week out drains you mentally but going out for a walk or running or gymming (in short burning some calories) get you fresh. But make no mistake
you need to take proper care while running or hitting the gym to prevent injury else there is no point.

Since the day i have started running i have lost 2 inches of my belly fat! I have never felt happier!
