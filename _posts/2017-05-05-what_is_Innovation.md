I say its true!

But not everyone has the same idea of what innovation is. Recently I had been in a competition about doing something **innovative**. But it was disappointing to know that the organizers had no clue what **innovation** actually meant. (Sad!)

For them **innovation** was just developing a great software that does something no other can (does something differently) or an idea that helps a sections of people perform some tasks that earns money. They had a narrow scope of vision to understand that **innovation** just doesn't mean a software that does something cool but it means that a simple service that can save an whole industry $$$ (in tens of thousands if not millions).

For me **innovation** is not just about having a service or software that earns money. Its about a service or software when used in right way can help save tonnes of money!

Lets take an example of few things that are **innovate** in their own way.

* The next Instagram - Yay, its going to be the next best thing for the youth of today and will earn the devs loads of cash! (Organizers see cash and fame!)

* Appliances are broken - A service on the move that will come to you house and repair your broken appliances! (Organizers see rivers of cash)

* Stream line and un-disrupt supply chain - A service with neat tricks (with software and method) that save the customer some much needed $$$ and expensive time so that they can invest that money and time in growing their business? (Organizers sadly dont think this as **innovative**)

Sadly the great minds that were tasked with the job of finding something **innovated** had such a limited set of knowledge that they failed to understand that saving money for the customers is **innovative** too.
