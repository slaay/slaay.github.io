Mundane
------------
There comes a time in a life of a software coder where things feel mundane, there are times when you want to pull your hair and shout, break some glass, kick something out of this world!.
In short you are frustrated and not happy. So what do you really do that time? I am relatively a new software coder and I do not have enough contact with a whole lot of other software codes to really know what do they do.

Spark
------------
Life is not always fair and no one said it will be, but there must be something that makes working fun!. Fun at work is not just games, picnics or high salary or high positions. All these things do not necessarily give you "Job satisfaction". As far I am concerned this rare little thing called Job satisfaction is very important for some people. This is because these are the peopled who are driven. Driven to work towards a dream, a dream of their own!. They have a spark
which sets them apart from the rest.

Something different
------------
I am not a great blogger so please bear with me if I happen not make sense sometimes ;). Its just that I feel like I am not moving ahead and the only way I will feel I am moving ahead is when I will do something that makes me say "Yes, this will make a difference to my life!". As of not that is not the case. I want to try something different ("trying" is one thing but actually "doing" is another). The time for trying is over, the time for "doing" has come.
