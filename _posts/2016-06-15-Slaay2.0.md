The past
------------
Its been a long long time since I last updated by website (2015 to precise). Back in the days I did'nt know the power of humble `include` (my website is in php, if you didn't know). 

   `<?php include_once("header.php") ?>`

   `<?php include_once("footer.php") ?>`

I used to add header and footer to each page. It was a nightmare to make changes to each and every page if there was a need. One of my colleague introduced me to
 `include` keyword in PHP and I couldn't thank him enough for it. It made my task so much easier making changes.

NO more making manual changes to the website!. Time to switch to WordPress and let it handle all the code and let me handle only the data! (again thanks to my friend RDX). He suggested to me that its better to have an WordPress website than having to manually add pages.
