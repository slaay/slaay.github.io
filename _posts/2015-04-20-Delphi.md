The Oracle of Delphi!
------------
She was the first girl I really understood. In the beginning when I first came to know Delphi, I was like "She is too complicated for me.". She used to give me headaches and nightmare, if I was to be with her for the rest of my career, sure this is not the way I should be feeling about her.

But when I start to understand her little by little and really really got a hang of what she is all about, it was really awesome. I still remember my 'Aha' moment for Delphi and how much joy She gave me when I started to know what I was really doing!.
She open my brain for a whole of great new things, knowing more about her every day, made my day!.

The good times
------------
We shared a really great times when we became very close and I even had the privilege to help spread the word about my love for her to other (training other :P). We together built great things, clean and awesome piece of structures. Though there are times
when we had problems with the stuff we built but we enjoyed every moment together!

The bad times
------------
There were times between us when I thought "Why god WHY!". But she still managed to be gentle, graceful, calm and by my side through everything. There were rough patches in our relationship which made me hate her to the core.
As I came to know more about her, even started to give more of herself too (mobile - iOS and Android ;))

Now. The present
------------
Though I still love Delphi, I think my time with her limited, I may need to break off with her so that I can move on and explore more of the world with some one else or may be with many more. Though she'll be my first love always, there are times when you need
to make a decision and not be forever trapped.
