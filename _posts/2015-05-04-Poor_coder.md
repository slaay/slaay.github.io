Tough nut to crack
------------
Sometimes my mind wanders and keeps wandering on over "Why is it so hard for some people to understand programmers?". Even programmers themselves do not understand others. Especially as you climb the ladder of so called "Seniority", lesser your understanding of other programmers!.

Beautiful beasts
------------
For me coders are god's beautiful creations, I might even call them beautiful beasts. The reason is simple, we programmers build
beautiful piece of art (Even though there are lots of bugs ;)). But it's not always that people will appreciate your work.
Even after working 100's of hours under neck deep pressure and delivering a near perfect piece of software based on a crappie idea, still people will not appreciate how much you have worked.

I am no saint
------------
Well I am not saying I understand all the programmers but I do my best. I just know how to bring the best of the people I work with.
I also know how to change my style of working to suit other people instead of making other change their style to suit mine. It helps a lot that way, as I am able to get the things done ;).

Things that make me think
------------
Sometimes people act really weird. I mean really really weird. As they only hear half of what you are saying and talk some non sense based on what tiny piece of knowledge that have that makes me think "do you really know what you are talking?". Sometimes it's very amusing when I let the other person enjoy the moment thinking that they are almighty. (I do that as I simply do not have the patience to deal with people in such cases. No matter how much you tell them or explain or show facts they WILL not listen to you).
