Moore's law
------------
Its states that [the number of transistors you cram on a IC will double every 2 years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)  Which is very much true and that is the reason why its called as a 'Law'. Hardware are getting really powerful and are able to churn a whole lot of big number in nano seconds, what this means for software developers is that 'really cheap and fast system' to code on !Yay!.
As the days are going by the projects are getting heavier, bigger and mightier and your lowly Pentium, Core duo, Semptrom will not be able to handle the load.

Bigger is better 
------------
In Software industry bigger is better for coder. Faster the machine, lesser the time you will spend on waiting for some S**t to load, something to compile/build or to event start ;(. I remember the kind of systems we had in college back in the day (2007-2010), They were only good for small tiny C, C++ or microscopic Java code. Since the hardware is cheaper it makes a great deal of sense to go for a bigger, better machine to code. Else you will be wasting a whole of time just to 'waiting' to code.

Those hogging IDEs!
------------
Its not just that the projects are getting bigger it that the IDEs are getting fatter and greedier. Now take example of [Delphi IDE](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=embarcadero+delphi&oq=embar&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59.9047j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8), the last IDE is a beast!. Though it damn powerful in what its supposed to do but it requires a good enough capable system to hold it down and let you code in peace( and not keep staring at it to load your project).

Frustration
------------
There are times that makes a coder a little frustrated with their system as they are still using something that the company should have upgraded and thrown out!
Load times are the worst for a programmer who is already under pressure and on top the system on which he is working on gives way. There a few things makes a coder happy and having a system that is fast is one of them. Now its not that the software company has to lose money by throwing away the old (older) system, they can always use it for testing their final software (more the merrier).
When we coders have a good system it relieves some of the pressure of work and you have more time to think about the problem at hand then worry about the system dying on you.
