Second anniversary
------------
Yes, Yes!!
Its been 2 years since *[Slaaysourcecoders](http://slaaysourcecoders.in/work/)* was born!. I'm feeling awesome!. Well I will not say, 
I never thought It was come to celebrate 2 years (I always knew, I will keep it going).

First anniversary
------------
I could not celebrate the first anniversay for some reasons, hey but *Better Late Than Never* as I would always say!

Some interesting facts
------------
How I came to select Slaaysourcecoders as the name? Actually *Slaay* is my Counter Strike team name. So I thought of using the same name.
Some of the other names I thought of are 

* Slaaycoders
* Slaaysoftwares
* slaaycoda
* Mobicoda
* Slaapcoda (as in Slaay App Coder)
* Sourcecoder
* Appsoucer

and the last one was *Slaaysourcecoders*

Special thanks
------------
* To Sanket, who helped me buy my first MAC.
* To Suraj, who thought me web hosting.
* To Videl, My Slaaysourcecoders Co Founder.
* To Casburn, My cousin and Slaay enforcer!
Finally to my Parents and all the Slaayers out there!
