The app that I will be making to control the drone will have to be simple and fast. The basic idea is as shown in the image above.
There are minimal controls. 
In the begining I would prefer to have the app control the drone and nothing else. After that if everything is going fine the next 
job will be to have the drone send out live images/video over the internet to the app.

App OS
------------
Another point in my head is which OS should I target for the app!
By the way I suck in Java, so the app will be an iOS app. But I do not have an iPhone and 99$ Apple [developer account](http://developer.apple.com).
Since I have an Android phone (it will be cheaper to buy one test phone also), I think I should learn JAVA or Delphi for Mobile [Embarcadero Delphi](http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi)
and use by experience in Delphi to build Native Like app for Android.
