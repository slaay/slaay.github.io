Internet of things is going to be a multi billion dollar industry and is taking the world of Information technology by storm.
There are a million (and a little bit more) possibilities.
I do want to be left out of the IOT storm as its going to be great leaning experience.

Here is my idea of IOT that I am working on, basically its a flying device (well inspired from other pioneers in Goa).
But I do not have any cash lying around to go and buy heavy duty quad copters. 


So the idea is
------------
* Get a Raspberry pi board (need to buy)
* A camera module for Raspberry pi board (need to buy)
* A Android powered Phone (Already have)
* a Drone (this is the most important bit)
  * I do not intend to buy a drone with camera as they are pretty expensive for me.

And get all the above bits and piece merged together to make a IOT device (home made I should say).
I want to make sure the whole setup does not cross 6 - 7K.

Well thats it. As of now I am hunting for a good cheap board to start with. More details later!
