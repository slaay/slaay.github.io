NetNeutrality 
------------
Is going viral all over as i write this blog. People are fighting to keep the INTERNET free for all. Now there is one side where even if the Internet is free from the latest assault on its freedom, some fanatic government guy(ministers and any who) will find a way to block site by getting their hands
on the servers where the whole website is hosted. Now its no a big deal for them to close down a couple of server to completely bring down the site to its knees.

Future of Internet
------------
The idea is pretty simple and awesome, *Make the Internet work like BitTorrent!*. That is to deliver all the websites through torrents. Accessing a website via
a torrent means that there will not be any centralized server serving the website content but the web will be powered by peers. If one peer is down some one else
will take its place. Basically the person who creates the site is the first seeder then the next person accessing is another seeder and so on.
The decentralized nature of the website will make it nearly impossible to shut down the site.

BitTorrent - [Maelstrom](http://project-maelstrom.bittorrent.com/)
------------
BitTorrent has already come with a browser that works on torrent file, though the content is limited as the project went live recently. The Maelstrom is Chromium-based browser, you can browse normal non torrent based website also. Dont worry if your site isn't a torrent file yet! BitTorrent guy have even made a tool that can do it for you. Check [Developer tools](https://github.com/bittorrent/torrent-web-tools).
