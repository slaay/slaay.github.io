For building my first Internet of Things flying device I need o get my hands on a Raspberry Pi board. Now why do i need this board?
Well i need it to be the heart of the whole system. The board will be running Android OS and it is going to connect to Internet
to get the commands that I will be sending from mobile app (oh yes! mobile app).
